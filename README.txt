Description:
This project contains the code to add a computerized opponent to an already created Battleship 
game.


Important Note:
-The original Battleships game was as a project for Chris Dovolis' Introduction to Algorithm's 
and Data Structures class at the University of Minnesota. The project required the creation of 
Board, Boat, Cell, Game, and BattleboatGUI classes. Methods and objects contained within these 
classes are incorporated within the Computer.java file. However, because solutions to the project 
cannot be posted online, only the Computer.java class, which was not included in the project's 
requirements can be posted.



Compile & Run:
Because the  additional classes required for the Battleship game to execute cannot be posted 
online, as they were originally created for a university project, the code within this file 
cannot be executed.



Limitations:
-The computer does not user any strategy when placing boats on its own board and does so randomly

-The computer does not use any strategy when choosing random locations to guess and may fire on cells
where logically, no boat could reside
